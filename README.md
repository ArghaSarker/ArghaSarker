### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Science and have a strong interest in deep learning and computer vision. In my masterâ€™s thesis, I focused on bioimage analysis using advanced deep learning techniques. I possess a solid theoretical and practical understanding of deep learning methodologies. I am eager to apply my skills and passion to new opportunities in the rapidly evolving fields of AI and deep learning.
