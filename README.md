### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Science and have a strong interest in data science, deep learning, and computer vision. In my masterâ€™s thesis, I focused on bioimage analysis using advanced deep learning techniques. 
As a research assistant, student assistant, and student tutor, I have gained extensive programming and debugging skills and possess a solid theoretical and practical understanding of data science and deep learning methodologies. I am eager to apply my skills and passion to new opportunities in the rapidly evolving fields of AI, deep learning, and data science.
